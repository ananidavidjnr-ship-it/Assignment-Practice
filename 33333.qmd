## 

#\*PRESENTATIONS ON MY ASSIGNMENT This file consist of the presentations of my assignments

```{r}
#| echo: true
names<-c("Kofi","Antoa","Kodzo")
ages<-c(3,4,5)
gender<-c("F","M","F")
myd<-data.frame(names,ages,gender)
f<-ages+3
f
```

Therefore the output of f is `r f` comment

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
